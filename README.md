# CSC142
This git repository hosts my class notes and work for assignments in CSC 142.
The primary purpose of keeping these files in a public repository is to allow for my own personal ease of copying, rather than collaboration or sharing.

While it should be obivous, do note that using material here may constitute plagarism, regardless of any other license.
